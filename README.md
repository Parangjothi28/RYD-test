# RYD-test
Problem statement was implemented.
Here are a few requirements.
Packages needed : PyMuPDF
Issues in the code :
1) Pages need to be classified as question or answer or explanation page.
2) If page does not fall into any of the above categories error will be thrown.
3) Question and answer numbers are cumulative, not divided into topics and sub topics.

The code now runs for only 5 pages but this could be changed by changing the range to include all page numbers.
However each page MUST classified correctly or error would be thrown
